# CS50 Final Project – Stock Management App

## Description

This project is my CS50 Final Project. It is a mobile stock management application developed using Flutter and SQLite.

The application allows users to manage product inventories by adding, editing, deleting, and searching products. Stock levels are tracked locally on the device, and products that reach critical stock levels are visually highlighted. Additionally, all product data can be exported as a PDF document.

The main goal of this project is to provide a simple, offline-capable inventory tracking solution while demonstrating practical use of Flutter, local databases, and file generation.
